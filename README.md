# Reasons

Sometimes, we maybe build some views repeatedly. Because we think that they just will be used under a condition. It's the curse
of breaking the rule: <b>DRY</b>. In fact, If we are conscious of view's reusing, we will make more efforts to make it
completely independent.

So for recording my growth, for writing less codes, for better tomorrow......

I should create this repository to summary some UI(cocoa Touch) extensions that are likely to be used in our work.

# List

## UIButton

- Set image alignment:

```swift
button.zon.setImage(image, imageAlignment: .top, spacing: 0, state: .normal)
```

Effect just like this:

![left margin image](https://github.com/ZeroOnet/Extensions/blob/master/Extensions/Display/leftMargin.png)
![right margin image](https://github.com/ZeroOnet/Extensions/blob/master/Extensions/Display/rightMargin.png)
![top image](https://github.com/ZeroOnet/Extensions/blob/master/Extensions/Display/top.png)

## UIImage

- Generate QR code:

```swift
QRImageView.image = UIImage.zon.qrImage(content: "æˆ‘(I) you ðŸ¤£", size: CGSize(width: 200, height: 200))
```

The QR code image as follows:<br></br>

- Rotate image with degree by clockwise.
- Compose image with color.
- Tint image with color.
- Read gif file.

## UIImageView

- Save image of UIImageView to album by Photos:

```swift
